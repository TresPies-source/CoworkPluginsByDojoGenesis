# CoworkPluginsByDojoGenesis

A practice space for building better software through patient cultivation. 44 skills organized into 7 behavioral plugins — each one a different way of paying attention to your work.

**Governance multiplies velocity.**

## Quick Start

Each plugin is self-contained with:

- `README.md` — Overview, skill table, trigger phrases
- `CONNECTORS.md` — External service integrations
- `agents/` — Agent persona definitions
- `commands/` — Command interface documentation
- `skills/` — Skill definitions (SKILL.md files with full workflows)

## Origin

Built by Dojo Genesis at Tres Pies Design. These plugins encode patterns discovered through practice — retrospectives, scouting sessions, specification writing, and the daily work of building software with autonomous agents.
