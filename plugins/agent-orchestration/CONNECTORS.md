# Agent Orchestration — Connector Integration Guide

This plugin works standalone but becomes significantly more powerful when integrated with external connectors. This document describes how each connector enhances the plugin's capabilities.

---

## Connector Overview

| Category | Placeholder | Included MCP Servers | Other Options |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Repository | `~~repository` | GitHub | GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps |
| Knowledge base | `~~knowledge base` | Notion | Confluence, Coda, Obsidian, Roam |
| Chat | `~~chat` | Slack | Microsoft Teams, Discord |
| Project tracker | `~~project tracker` | Linear | Asana, Jira, ClickUp, Monday.com |

---

## Repository Integration (`~~repository`)

### Default: GitHub

**Purpose:** Link handoffs, decisions, and specs to code repositories.

### Enhanced Workflows

#### With `/handoff`

**Without connector:**
- Handoff package references files by relative path
- No verification that files exist
- No link to actual code

**With ~~repository:**
- Link to specific files using repo URLs with line numbers
- Reference pull requests and issues directly
- Include commit SHAs for exact context
- Verify that referenced files exist before creating handoff

**Example:**
```markdown
## Required Context

**Pattern Files:**
- [`frontend/src/components/Navigation/Sidebar.tsx` (lines 45-120)](https://github.com/org/repo/blob/main/frontend/src/components/Navigation/Sidebar.tsx#L45-L120)
- See PR #234 for discussion on navigation patterns

**Related Issues:**
- Resolves #456 (breadcrumb navigation)
- Blocked by #123 (auth implementation)
```

#### With `/navigate-workspace`

**Enhanced capabilities:**
- Show open PRs related to active work
- Link handoffs to specific branches
- Track commit activity on specs
- Display PR status in workspace map

**Example output:**
```
## Active Work (7 items)

### Specifications (2)
- `2026-02-11_breadcrumb_spec.md` (Active)
  - PR #234: In Review (2 approvals, 1 requested change)
  - Last commit: 3 hours ago

### Handoffs (1)
- `2026-02-11_handoff_breadcrumb.md` → Zenflow (Ready)
  - Branch: feature/breadcrumb-nav
  - Status: 15 commits ahead of main
```

#### With `/propagate-decision`

**Enhanced capabilities:**
- Commit decision as atomic change with conventional commit message
- Link decision to related PRs or issues
- Tag decision in commit for traceability
- Create decision-tracking branch if needed

**Example workflow:**
1. Decision recorded: "Auth bypass for v0.2.0"
2. All documents updated
3. Single commit created:
   ```
   docs(decision): Record auth bypass for v0.2.0

   - Removes auth from v0.2.0 scope
   - Adds auth to v0.2.2 scope
   - Updates STATUS.md and master plan

   Decision-ID: DEC-001
   Closes #456
   ```

### Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",

📚 New Teaching: Context Management

@cipher, I created a teaching artifact on context management based on what I learned today. It covers the 3-7 idea threshold and when to compress context.

🔗 teaching/2026-02-11_context_management.md

Let's practice together — try it on your next task and share what you discover!
```

## Multi-Connector Workflows

### Example: Full-Stack Handoff

**Scenario:** Handing off a feature implementation with full traceability

**Connectors used:** ~~repository, ~~knowledge base, ~~chat, ~~project tracker

**Workflow:**
1. `/handoff feature X implementation to Zenflow`
2. Claude creates handoff package with:
   - Links to GitHub files and PRs (~~repository)
   - Links to Notion spec and design docs (~~knowledge base)
3. Saves handoff to workspace
4. Creates Linear ticket with handoff details (~~project tracker)
5. Notifies Zenflow in Slack (~~chat)
6. Agent accepts handoff:
   - Updates Linear ticket status
   - Responds in Slack thread
   - Checks out GitHub branch
7. Work progresses with status synced across all systems

### Example: Decision with Full Propagation

**Scenario:** Architectural decision affects multiple systems

**Connectors used:** ~~repository, ~~knowledge base, ~~chat, ~~project tracker

**Workflow:**
1. `/propagate-decision auth bypass for v0.2.0`
2. Claude:
   - Records decision in local docs
   - Updates all affected local documents
   - Commits changes to GitHub with tagged commit (~~repository)
   - Syncs decision to Notion decision log (~~knowledge base)
   - Creates tickets for affected work items (~~project tracker)
   - Posts decision summary to Slack (~~chat)
3. All systems reflect decision:
   - GitHub: Decision committed and tagged
   - Notion: Decision log updated
   - Linear: Tickets created/updated
   - Slack: Team notified and acknowledges

## Connector Setup

### Prerequisites

Each connector requires:
1. MCP server configured in `.mcp.json`
2. Authentication credentials (API keys, OAuth tokens)
3. Appropriate permissions in external system

### Minimal Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    },
    "notion": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.notion.com/mcp"
    },
    "slack": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.slack.com/mcp"
    },
    "linear": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing Connectivity

```bash
# Test each connector
claude plugin test agent-orchestration --connector github
claude plugin test agent-orchestration --connector notion
claude plugin test agent-orchestration --connector slack
claude plugin test agent-orchestration --connector linear

# Test all connectors
claude plugin test agent-orchestration --all-connectors
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connector Not Found

**Symptom:** Command references `~~repository` but no integration happens

**Cause:** Connector not configured in `.mcp.json`

**Fix:** Add connector to `.mcp.json` and restart Claude

### Authentication Issues

**Symptom:** "Unauthorized" or "Permission denied" errors

**Cause:** Missing or expired credentials

**Fix:**
1. Verify API key / OAuth token is current
2. Check permissions in external system
3. Re-authenticate if needed

### Partial Integration

**Symptom:** Some features work, others don't

**Cause:** Partial permissions or incomplete configuration

**Fix:**
1. Review connector-specific configuration
2. Verify all required scopes/permissions
3. Check connector documentation for requirements

## Future Connectors

Potential future integrations:
- **Jira** (project tracker alternative)
- **Confluence** (knowledge base alternative)
- **Microsoft Teams** (chat alternative)
- **GitLab** (repository alternative)
- **Obsidian** (knowledge base for local-first workflows)
- **Discord** (chat alternative for communities)
