# Agent Orchestration

_Handoffs are sacred relays._

## What it does

Agent Orchestration conducts the ensemble. It routes work between agents, teaches across handoffs, propagates decisions, and navigates shared workspace. Governance multiplies velocity — when handoffs are clean.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| handoff-protocol | Execute clean, complete handoffs between agents |
| workspace-navigation | Share context and tools across agents |
| agent-teaching | Transfer knowledge and patterns in handoffs |
| decision-propagation | Ensure decisions flow to all who need them |
| granular-visibility | Track progress at the level the user needs to steer |

## When to use

- **"Multiple agents need to work on this"** — Handoff protocol first
- **"Agent A finished; Agent B needs context"** — Teaching handoff
- **"Decision was made but downstream agent didn't know"** — Propagate it
- **"Workspace is messy and overlapping"** — Navigate and clarify

## The Loop

Orchestrates the ORCHESTRATE phase: clear handoffs, shared workspace, decision flow. Enables parallel work that stays coherent and fast.
