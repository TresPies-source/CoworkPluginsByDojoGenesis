description: "Investigate empty directories before creating content, because they may be intentional references to content that lives elsewhere. Ask 'Is this a pointer or a gap?' before filling the void. Use when encountering empty skill or component directories, when coverage gaps exist that nobody has complained about, during audits or registry reorganizations, or before creating content to fill something that feels incomplete. Trigger phrases: 'this directory is empty', 'missing SKILL.md', 'coverage gap', 'fill the void', 'why is this empty'."

# Pointer Directories

## Philosophy

Empty directories are not failures of the system. They are signals. In well-designed registries, an empty directory often means: "The content you're looking for exists elsewhere by design." The instinct to fill every gap produces duplication and masks the actual provenance of content.

Before creating content, understand why something is empty. This distinction separates accidental incompleteness from intentional reference architecture.

## When to Use

- You encounter empty directories during a registry audit or reorganization
- A coverage metric shows "gaps" that nobody has reported as problems
- You find a skill, component, or module in a registry with no local content
- A project registry reports missing SKILL.md, README, or component files
- You're about to create content to fill an apparent void
- You're building changelog entries and need to account for "missing" content

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the Empty Directory

Locate the directory that appears incomplete. Note its location and expected content type (skill, component, configuration, etc.).

### 2. Ask the Provenance Question

**"Is this directory a pointer or a gap?"**

A pointer is intentional. A gap is accidental. You need to know which one before proceeding.

### 3. Check Three Levels

Search for the content at other levels:

- **Source Level**: Original authoring location (e.g., dojo-genesis/skills/)
- **System-Installed Level**: Deployed to runtime (e.g., .skills/skills/, system packages)
- **Platform Level**: Provided by host platform (e.g., Cowork system skills, external dependencies)

### 4. Determine Status

- **Found at another level?** → It's a pointer. Document the provenance.
- **Found nowhere?** → It's a gap. Create content or mark for later.
- **Unclear?** → Ask the team or check the changelog.

### 5. Document Your Finding

If it's a pointer:

- Record which level holds the authoritative content
- Add an entry to the changelog explaining the provenance
- Consider whether a symlink, reference, or comment in the empty directory would help future maintainers

If it's a gap:

- Decide whether to create content now or defer
- If deferring, add a note explaining why the gap exists

## Best Practices

**Verify before Creating**: Always check multiple locations before assuming content is missing. Empty directories are often intentional.

**Copy from Authoritative Source**: If content exists elsewhere, copy from the authoritative source rather than recreating it. This preserves accuracy and reduces drift.

**Document Provenance**: When a directory is a pointer, make that relationship visible. Use comments, changelogs, or README entries to explain why the directory is empty and where content lives.

**Treat Coverage Metrics as Signals, Not Rules**: A coverage gap may reflect reality or reflect the structure of your registry. Investigate before accepting it as a problem.

**Ask Before Filling**: When you encounter an empty directory, the first question is "Why is this empty?" not "What content should go here?"

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Searched at least two other levels (source, system, platform) before concluding content is missing
- [ ] Can articulate why this directory is empty (if empty by design)
- [ ] If content exists elsewhere, identified the authoritative source
- [ ] Checked the changelog or team documentation for context
- [ ] If creating content, confirmed it's because a gap exists, not because a pointer looks incomplete
- [ ] Documented the provenance decision for future maintainers

## Common Pitfalls

**Mistaking pointers for gaps**: You see an empty skill directory and assume someone forgot to write the skill. Investigate first.

**Creating duplicate content**: You write a new SKILL.md for a skill that already exists at the system level. Check system-installed locations.

**Ignoring the "nobody complained" signal**: A gap has existed for months and nobody has filed an issue. This often means it's not actually a gap.

**Treating all empty directories the same**: Some empty directories are intentional pointers; others are true gaps. Each one needs investigation.

**Skipping the changelog**: The history of why something is empty often lives in the changelog. Check there before deciding.
