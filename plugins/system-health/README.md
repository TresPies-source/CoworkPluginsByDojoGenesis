# System Health

_You cannot improve what you do not observe._

## What it does

System Health watches the growing system. It audits documentation, tracks skill health, maps semantic clusters, and surfaces what's working and what needs tending. Observation is the first step of healing.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| health-audit | Monitor skill and system vitality |
| documentation-audit | Scan docs for drift and gaps |
| skill-audit-upgrade | Evaluate skills for relevance and strength |
| semantic-clusters | Map conceptual terrain for coherence |
| status-writing | Report health in human language |
| status-template | Structure consistent health reports |
| repo-context-sync | Keep project structure aligned with reality |
| repo-status | Snapshot current system state |
| pointer-directories | Investigate empty directories before filling them |

## When to use

- **"Is our documentation still accurate?"** — Run an audit
- **"Which skills are stale?"** — Health check each one
- **"Our system feels fragmented"** — Map semantic clusters
- **"What's the real state of things?"** — Observation first, then action

## The Loop

Observes in the OBSERVE phase: audit, measure, map, report. Surfaces the truth so Learn and Strategize can respond with clarity.
