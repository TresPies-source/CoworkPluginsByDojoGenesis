# Skill Forge

_The meta-layer — skills about making skills._

## What it does

Skill Forge grows your capability to grow capabilities. It transforms processes into reusable skills, maintains skill health, manages the knowledge architecture, and cultivates the discipline of intentional pattern work.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| skill-creation | Design and define new skills from scratch |
| process-extraction | Harvest proven processes into skills |
| skill-maintenance | Keep skills relevant and sharp |
| file-management | Organize skill definitions and knowledge structure |

## When to use

- **"We keep doing this process manually"** — Forge it into a skill
- **"This skill is outdated"** — Maintain and refresh it
- **"How do we scale what works?"** — Skill library, not heroics
- **"Where should this live in the architecture?"** — Thoughtful file structure

## The Loop

Builds in the BUILD meta-layer: take patterns, forge skills, maintain the skill forest. Strengthens every phase of Strategize → Specify → Orchestrate → Observe → Learn → Remember.
