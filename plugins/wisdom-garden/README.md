# Wisdom Garden

_Knowledge is planted, cultivated, and harvested._

## What it does

Wisdom Garden transforms raw learning into living seed banks of reusable insight. It writes memory notes, compresses context, harvests skills from processes, and grows a personal knowledge ecosystem. Every lesson becomes a pattern others can plant.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| memory-garden | Capture insights as seeds for future retrieval |
| compression-ritual | Distill complexity into portable clarity |
| seed-extraction | Extract patterns from experience |
| seed-library | Organize seeds by domain and use |
| seed-to-skill-converter | Harvest seeds into reusable skills |
| voice-before-structure | Ground structural artifacts in project philosophy |

## When to use

- **"We keep solving the same problem"** — Plant it as a seed
- **"How do we capture what we learned?"** — Write memory notes now
- **"This pattern works everywhere"** — Harvest it into a skill
- **"Knowledge keeps walking out the door"** — Build a garden instead

## The Loop

Harvests in the REMEMBER phase: distill learning into seeds, compress wisdom, grow the skill library. Keeps the entire ecosystem nourished and retrievable.
