# /position -- Reframe a Binary Product Decision

**Argument hint:** `<binary decision -- 'should we keep or deprecate X'>`

---

## Philosophy

Most binary choices are false binaries. "Keep or kill" assumes the value of a product is fixed. This command breaks free from the binary trap by asking a more powerful question: **"What is this uniquely good at?"** Value is contextual -- a product's worth depends on the context in which it's used.

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Name the Binary Trap

Accept a binary decision from the user:
- "Keep vs. deprecate"
- "Build vs. buy"
- "Native vs. web"
- "Feature A vs. Feature B"

Name the trap explicitly:

> "This is being framed as [A] vs. [B]. That binary framing limits our thinking because it assumes [implicit assumption]. Let's break free from it."

Explain briefly why binary framing is limiting: it assumes fixed value, forces competition instead of complementarity, and narrows the solution space.

### Step 2: Introduce the Unlocking Question

Ask the unlocking question:

> **"What is [option A] uniquely good at that [option B] isn't?"**

Ask the user to answer from their perspective. They often know the answer intuitively but haven't been asked the question in this way.

If the user struggles, help by exploring contexts:
- In what situation would a user reach for [A] over [B]?
- What can [A] do effortlessly that [B] struggles with?
- Who uses [A] that would never use [B]?

### Step 3: Map the Unique Value

For each option, explore the unique value through three lenses:

1. **Context:** When/where/why does a user reach for this?
2. **Audience:** Who benefits most from this?
3. **Job-to-be-done:** What task does this do better than anything else?

Create a unique value map:

| Lens | Option A | Option B |
|------|----------|----------|
| Context | [when/where/why] | [when/where/why] |
| Audience | [who benefits most] | [who benefits most] |
| Job-to-be-done | [unique task] | [unique task] |

### Step 4: Re-Scout Beyond the Binary

With unique values identified, generate **3+ positioning options** that go beyond the original binary:

1. **Complement:** Each option has a unique role, and they work together
2. **Specialize:** Each option deepens into its unique context
3. **Sunset-with-succession:** One option gracefully hands off its unique value to the other
4. **Tier:** Options serve different user segments or pricing tiers

Present options without recommending one. Ask the user which resonates.

### Step 5: Synthesize the Positioning Statement

Based on user feedback, synthesize a positioning statement:

> **"[Product/Feature] is for [context/audience] who need [job-to-be-done]. Unlike [alternative], it [unique value]."**

Produce a positioning brief with these sections:

## Quality Gate

Before delivering, verify:

- [ ] The binary trap is named and explained at the start
- [ ] The unlocking question was asked and answered
- [ ] Unique values are mapped across context, audience, and job-to-be-done
- [ ] At least 3 positioning options beyond the binary are presented
- [ ] No single option was recommended before gathering user feedback
- [ ] A clear positioning statement is produced
- [ ] The before/after reframe is documented explicitly
- [ ] The output is saved as a dated markdown file
