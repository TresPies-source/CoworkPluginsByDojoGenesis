# Strategic Thinking

_Begin with a tension, not a solution._

## What it does

Strategic Thinking plants the seeds of clarity in complex product landscapes. It helps you scout multiple surfaces, position offerings sharply, and move iteratively from vision to tactical reality. Use this when strategy feels scattered.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| strategic-scout | Map competitive terrain and find your natural positioning |
| product-positioning | Sharpen how you articulate unique value |
| multi-surface-strategy | Balance market, user, and business perspectives |
| iterative-scouting | Scout → test → refine in repeatable cycles |
| strategic-to-tactical-workflow | Convert strategy into actionable specifications |

## When to use

- **"We're unclear on positioning"** — Scout multiple surfaces before deciding
- **"Which direction should we take?"** — Tension-mapping reveals natural paths
- **"Strategy feels disconnected from work"** — Bridge strategic vision to tactical specs
- **"How do we compete?"** — Position distinctly by understanding the full landscape

## The Loop

Plants seeds in the STRATEGIZE phase: clarify tensions, map surfaces, position boldly — then hand the grown understanding to Specify.
