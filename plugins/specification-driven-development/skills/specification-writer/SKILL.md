**Created:** [Date]  
**Grounded In:** [What this builds on - previous versions, research, feedback]

## 1. Vision

> A single, compelling sentence that captures the essence of this release.

**The Core Insight:**
[2-3 paragraphs explaining WHY this release matters, what problem it solves, and how it advances the overall vision]

**What Makes This Different:**
[2-3 paragraphs explaining what makes this approach unique, innovative, or better than alternatives]

## 2. Goals & Success Criteria

**Primary Goals:**
1. [Specific, measurable goal]
2. [Specific, measurable goal]
3. [Specific, measurable goal]

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ [Concrete, testable criterion]
- ✅ [Concrete, testable criterion]
- ✅ [Concrete, testable criterion]

**Non-Goals (Out of Scope):**
- ❌ [What this release explicitly does NOT include]
- ❌ [What is deferred to future versions]
```

### Part 2: Technical Architecture (40-50% of document)

```markdown
## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 System Overview

[High-level diagram or description of how components fit together]

**Key Components:**
1. **[Component Name]** - [Purpose and responsibility]
2. **[Component Name]** - [Purpose and responsibility]
3. **[Component Name]** - [Purpose and responsibility]

### 3.2 [Feature/Component 1] - Detailed Design

**Purpose:** [What this component does and why it's needed]

**Architecture:**

[Detailed explanation with diagrams if helpful]

**Backend Implementation (Go):**

```go
// Complete, production-ready code example
package [package_name]

type [StructName] struct {
    Field1 string `json:"field1"`
    Field2 int    `json:"field2"`
}

func (s *[StructName]) [MethodName]() error {
    // Implementation with error handling
    return nil
}
```

**Frontend Implementation (React/TypeScript):**

```typescript
// Complete, production-ready code example
interface [InterfaceName] {
  field1: string;
  field2: number;
}

export const [ComponentName]: React.FC<Props> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<StateType>(initialState);
  
  // Implementation
  
  return (
    <div className="...">
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**API Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint | Request | Response | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/[resource]` | `{ field: value }` | `{ id: string }` | [Description] |
| GET | `/api/v1/[resource]/:id` | - | `{ data: object }` | [Description] |

**Database Schema (if applicable):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE [table_name] (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    field1 TEXT NOT NULL,
    field2 INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_[field] ON [table_name]([field]);
```

**Integration Points:**
- Integrates with [existing component] via [method]
- Depends on [existing service] for [functionality]
- Extends [existing pattern] from v[X.X.X]

**Performance Considerations:**
- [Specific optimization or constraint]
- [Caching strategy or database indexing]
- [Expected latency or throughput]

### 3.3 [Feature/Component 2] - Detailed Design

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Vague Goals:** "Improve user experience" → ✅ "Reduce context loading time by 50%"  
❌ **Missing Code Examples:** High-level description only → ✅ Complete, runnable code  
❌ **Unrealistic Timelines:** "2 days for full backend" → ✅ "2 weeks with phased approach"  
❌ **No Risk Assessment:** Assumes everything will work → ✅ Identifies risks and mitigations  
❌ **Incomplete Testing:** "We'll test it" → ✅ Specific test cases and coverage targets  
❌ **No Integration Points:** Treats feature as isolated → ✅ Documents how it connects to existing system

---

## Usage Instructions

1. **Read this skill** before writing any specification
2. **Copy the template** structure to your new document
3. **Fill in each section** with specific, detailed content
4. **Run the quality checklist** before finalizing
5. **Study example specifications** for patterns and depth
6. **Iterate** until every checklist item is ✅

## Skill Metadata

**Token Savings:** ~10,000-15,000 tokens per specification (no need to re-read old specs for patterns)  
**Quality Impact:** Ensures consistency across all specifications  
**Maintenance:** Update when new patterns emerge from successful releases
