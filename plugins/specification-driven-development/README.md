# Specification-Driven Development

_A specification is a contract, not documentation._

## What it does

Specification-Driven Development cultivates precise contracts before a line of code is written. It bridges strategy to implementation, coordinates parallel tracks, and ensures everyone sees the same blueprint. Specifications unlock velocity.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| release-specification | Define complete feature contract end-to-end |
| specification-writer | Structure specs that serve both humans and systems |
| frontend-from-backend | Derive frontend requirements from backend reality |
| zenflow-prompt-writer | Translate specs into AI-ready prompts |
| pre-implementation-checklist | Validate specs before building |
| parallel-tracks | Coordinate multiple workstreams from one spec |
| planning-with-files | Spec using actual project structure |
| context-ingestion | Absorb existing context into specifications |
| implementation-prompt | Convert spec directly into builder instructions |
| spec-constellation-to-prompt-suite | Expand specs into coordinated prompt suites |

## When to use

- **"Let's start building"** — Slow down. Write a spec first.
- **"Frontend and backend are misaligned"** — One spec, one truth
- **"How do I brief an AI coder?"** — Transform spec to implementation prompt
- **"We have 3 teams working on this"** — Parallel tracks from one spec container

## The Loop

Cultivates the SPECIFY phase: harvest strategy clarity, grow contracts, prepare the ground for builders. Hands off a complete blueprint to Orchestrate.
