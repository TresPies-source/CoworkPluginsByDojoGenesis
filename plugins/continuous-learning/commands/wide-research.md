# /wide-research

Conduct broad landscape research to survey a domain, identify patterns, and find opportunities. Produces a landscape map with an opportunity matrix.

## Behavior

### Phase 1: Define Landscape

Clarify the domain with the user:
- What domain, market, or technology space?
- What are the boundaries? What's in scope vs out?
- What are we looking for (patterns, tools, approaches)?
- How will we know when we've covered enough ground?

Produce a landscape brief with: Problem space, Goal, Boundaries, Success criteria.

### Phase 2: Rapid Scanning

Survey 15-20 sources quickly. For each:
- One-sentence summary
- Relevance rating (1-5)
- Key takeaway

Prioritize breadth over depth. Spend 5-10 minutes per source max. Move on quickly — don't get stuck in details.

Present as a source scan table.

### Phase 3: Pattern Recognition

Identify across all sources:
- **Recurring themes** — what keeps coming up?
- **Outliers** — what's surprising?
- **Gaps** — what's NOT being discussed?
- **Trends** — what's changing?

Cluster findings into categories with maturity assessment (Emerging / Growing / Mature).

### Phase 4: Opportunity Matrix

Map findings on a 2x2 grid — Impact (high/low) x Feasibility (high/low):

```
          High Impact
              |
   Quick Wins | Big Bets
              |
  ────────────┼────────────
              |
   Fill Later | Avoid
              |
          Low Impact

  High Feasibility ← → Low Feasibility
```

Identify the high-impact, high-feasibility quadrant. Recommend top 3 focus areas with next steps.

## Output

Landscape brief with:
- **Domain Definition** — problem space and boundaries
- **Source Scan** — table with summary, relevance rating, key takeaway per source
- **Patterns & Themes** — clustered findings with maturity assessment
- **Outliers & Innovations** — surprising or unique findings
- **Gaps** — what's missing in the landscape
- **Opportunity Matrix** — 2x2 grid with impact/feasibility ratings
- **Recommended Focus Areas** — top 3 areas with next steps
