# Continuous Learning

_The process is the purpose._

## What it does

Continuous Learning turns inquiry into skill. It researches deeply, synthesizes across sources, debugs complexity, and explores new terrain with patience. Every investigation strengthens your thinking, not just your answers.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| retrospective | Extract learning from what just happened |
| research-modes | Choose research approach by question type |
| research-synthesis | Weave findings into coherent insight |
| project-exploration | Understand unfamiliar codebases and domains |
| debugging | Investigate root causes systematically |
| web-research | Gather and validate external knowledge |
| patient-learning-protocol | Learn without rushing understanding |
| era-architecture | Understand systems across time and scale |

## When to use

- **"Why did that fail?"** — Debug, don't just fix
- **"We don't understand the space yet"** — Explore patiently
- **"What did we learn?"** — Retrospect before moving on
- **"What's the state of the art?"** — Synthesize across sources

## The Loop

Learns in the LEARN phase: investigate observation, synthesize findings, explore unknown terrain. Feeds clarity back to Strategize and Specify.
